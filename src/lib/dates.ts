 * Week System Rules:
 * - Weeks run Sunday â†’ Saturday
 * - Week 1 starts on the last Sunday of December (typically Dec 26-29)
 * - Standard work year = 52 weeks (364 days)
 * - Week 53 exists ONLY if:
 *   1. Week 52 ends on December 24th or earlier, AND
 *   2. A full Sunday-Saturday week can fit ending on/before December 31st
 *
 * Examples:
 * - 2024-2025: Week 1 = Dec 29, 2024 | Week 52 = Dec 27, 2025 | No Week 53
 * - 2027-2028: Week 1 = Dec 26, 2027 | Week 52 = Dec 23, 2028 | Week 53 = Dec 24-30, 2028
